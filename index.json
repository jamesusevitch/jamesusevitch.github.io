However, determining an arbitrary graph's robustness is a highly nontrivial problem. This paper introduces a novel method for determining the r- and (r,s)-robustness of digraphs using mixed integer linear programming; to the best of the authors' knowledge it is the first time that mixed integer programming methods have been applied to the robustness determination problem. The approach only requires knowledge of the graph Laplacian matrix, and can be formulated with binary integer variables. Mixed integer programming algorithms such as branch-and-bound are used to iteratively tighten the lower and upper bounds on r and s.

A growing body of resilient control techniques based upon the Mean-Subsequence-Reduced (MSR) class of algorithms have been proposed which enable the consensus of normally behaving agents despite attacks and faults. Impressive results have been obtained using these algorithms, but there is still much potential for future research.

We introduce a novel continuous time resilient controller to guarantee that normally behaving agents can converge to a formation with respect to a set of leaders. The controller employs a norm-based filtering mechanism, and unlike most prior algorithms, also incorporates input bounds. In addition, the controller is shown to guarantee convergence in finite time. A sufficient condition for the controller to guarantee convergence is shown to be a graph theoretical structure which we denote as Resilient Directed Acyclic Graph (RDAG). Further, we employ our filtering mechanism on a discrete time system which is shown to have exponential convergence.

Prior results have established algorithms and graph structures for multi-agent networks which guarantee the consensus of normally behaving agents in the presence of a bounded number of misbehaving agents. The final consensus value is guaranteed to fall within the convex hull of initial agent states. However, the problem of consensus tracking considers consensus to arbitrary reference values which may not lie within such bounds.

These properties serve as sufficient conditions guaranteeing the success of certain consensus algorithms in networks with misbehaving agents present. Due to the complexity of determining the robustness for an arbitrary graph, several methods have previously been proposed for identifying the robustness of specific classes of graphs or constructing graphs with specified robustness levels. The majority of such approaches have focused on undirected graphs. In this paper we identify a class of scalable directed graphs whose edge set is determined by a parameter k and prove that the robustness of these graphs is also determined by k. We support our results through computer simulations.","tags":null,"title":"r-Robustness and (r, s)-robustness of Circulant Graphs","type":"publication"}]
